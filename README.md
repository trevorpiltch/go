# Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go
This repo is my lab to practice and learn the Go language from the book [Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/powerful-command-line-applications/9781680509311/). The code here is written by me, but all credit goes to the author of the motioned book.

## MOTIVATION
I chose this book to learn Go for my OmniSync project and wanted a more technical book than just a language introduction. After learning C and working a little in Rust, it seemed like Go was the next logical language to learn. I'm also curious to see how it differs from the other systems languages I know.

## BUILDING
This code can be run on any machine that has the Go language installed. Each folder is a self-contained module that can be built using the `go build main.go` command from the `cmd/` directory.
